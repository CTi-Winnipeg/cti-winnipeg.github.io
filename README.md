# CTI Winnipeg

## Purpose
We believe that with everything we do, we are changing the way people think about Canadian Tire and what life is like in Canada by leading Canadian Tire to become a design focused organization.

We are here to **To move life in Canada forward**.


## Principles

1. Put the users first and the business second
    * Start with why
    * Know and respect the audience (personas)
    * Align business objectives with audience goals
    * Personalization, not invasion
    * Do no harm
2. Ask questions, challenge assumptions
    * Find the right problem to solve
    * Don’t be satisfied with the status quo
3. Figure out the “Core” before “more”
    * Determine what it has to do before all the things it can do
    * Something is better than nothing, but our thing must be better than that
4. Intentional interventions
    * Logical innovation, not novelty
    * Be the cause, own the effect
    * Seek out unintentional consequences
5. Misfit
    * Adapt; not adopt
    * Square pegs in round holes
    * See things differently


## Process
We engineer delightful experiences anywhere someone will interact with any of the CTC brands with our take on the design process and scientific method:

* Learn
* Plan
* Prove
* Evolve
