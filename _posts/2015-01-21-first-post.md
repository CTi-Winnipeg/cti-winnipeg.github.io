# "To the _innovation station_!"


Although we’re serious about what we do, this phrase is used more tongue-in-cheek than anything.  It is our war-cry.  Our call-to-arms.  Conceived mainly of caffeine and sugar; with a healthy does of excitement.

Ask our peers in the DevOps team what we do, and we get a lot of blank stares and blinky eyes. Truth be told, it was fairly time-consuming for us at first to define exactly what that is. We knew what we were doing, but finding a way to articulate it to our peers can sometimes prove to be challenging. 

We have a long road ahead of us.  Uncovering the mysteries of "descience" (design + science, LOL), and help keep our organization moving quickly into the future.
  
  
Until next time,
